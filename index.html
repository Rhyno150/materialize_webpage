                        Full stack web development for 4IR means building websites and applications that combine
                        physical and digital technologies, like sensors and AI, to create interactive and smart experiences. It involves
                        designing and developing the front-end (what users see and interact with), the back-end (the server and
                        database that store and manage data), and the middleware (the connection between the physical and digital worlds).
                        This requires knowledge of various programming languages, frameworks, and tools, such as HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, and AI/ML libraries, to create seamless and efficient interactions between humans, machines, and data.

                            <p>Mandela House is a special place in Soweto, Johannesburg. It was the home of Nelson
                                Mandela, a famous leader who fought against apartheid and became the first black president of South Africa.
                                He lived there with his family from 1946 to 1962, before he was sent to prison for 27 years. The house is now a museum,
                                showing how the Mandela family lived and what life was like during apartheid. You can see Mandela's old bedroom,
                                the kitchen, and even the original furniture. The house has been kept the same as it was when Mandela lived
                                there, so it feels like stepping back in time. It's a powerful and moving place to visit, reminding us of the
                                struggles of the past and the importance of fighting for equality and freedom.</p>

                            <p>Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg is a historic site that has played a significant role
                                in South Africa's journey towards democracy. Once a fort and prison, it held notable figures like Mahatma Gandhi
                                and Nelson Mandela, who were both imprisoned there for fighting against injustice. The hill is now
                                home to the Constitutional Court, the highest court in the land, which was built on the site of the
                                old prison. The court's design incorporates elements of the old prison, symbolizing the transformation
                                from oppression to freedom. The hill also features the Mandela Cell, a museum showcasing the former
                                president's cell and personal belongings. Additionally, the site includes the Women's Gaol, where many
                                female activists were held, and Old Fort, which dates back to 1892. Today, Constitutional Hill serves
                                as a powerful symbol of South Africa's transition to democracy and a beacon of hope for human rights.</p>
